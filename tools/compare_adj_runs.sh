# Bit-compare two MITgcm adjoint run directories, optionally waiting for a job
# to finish first.
#
#   tools/compare_adj_runs.sh [options] <reference-run-dir> <new-run-dir>
#
# Options:
#   --wait <jobid>    poll squeue until that job leaves the queue, then compare.
#                     Requires TWO consecutive empty squeue results 60 s apart,
#                     so a transient squeue failure cannot be mistaken for
#                     "the job finished" and compare a half-written run.
#   --report <file>   where to write the report
#                     (default: <new-run-dir>/comparison_vs_<ref basename>.txt)
#   --no-report       print the report but write no file
#   --work <dir>      keep the intermediate listings here (default: a mktemp dir)
#   -h, --help        this message
#
# Exit status: 0 if the two runs are equivalent, 1 if not, 2 on a usage error.
#
# What it compares, in seven sections: job completion; the file inventory;
# every ADJ*/adxx* sensitivity field; every other common file; the cost
# function; the %MON monitor stream; then a verdict.
#
# Three differences are EXPECTED between a run with useGrdchk=.TRUE. and one
# with it .FALSE., and are classified rather than reported as failures:
#
#   data.pkg              the flag itself
#   output_tap_adj.txt    grdchk's ph-test / ph-grd chatter
#   xx_theta.effective.*  grdchk leaves its last probe's perturbation behind --
#                         exactly one element differing by exactly grdchk_eps
#
# The old run's grdchk also emits extra %MON lines after the main run, so the
# monitor comparison matches the new run's lines against the reference run's
# LEADING BLOCK of the same length rather than comparing wholesale.
#
# A fourth difference is EXPECTED between two runs of the PROFILER build
# (tapProfile) and is likewise classified rather than reported as a failure:
#
#   tapenade_profile.NNNN.txt   Tapenade's per-rank cost/benefit tables carry
#                               measured CPU seconds and are sorted by them, so
#                               the timings and the row order differ run to run.
#                               They are compared with the times masked and the
#                               rows sorted; the call sites, call counts, peak
#                               stack and memory gains left must match exactly,
#                               or the file counts as an unexpected difference.
#
# Deliberately no `set -e`: every check must run, and the report must be
# written even when an earlier one fails.
#
# Example -- schedule it to run when an adjoint job finishes (the job-chaining
# recipe in the project notes covers this pattern in full):
#
#   ADJ=$(../../../tools/submit.sh scripts/submit_tapAdj.sh --parsable | tail -1)
#   sbatch --parsable --dependency=afterany:$ADJ run_comparison.sh
